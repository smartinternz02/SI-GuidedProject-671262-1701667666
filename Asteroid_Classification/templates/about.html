    <h1>Few Words About Asteroid</h1>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>Only one asteroid, 4 Vesta, which has a relatively reflective surface, is normally visible to the naked eye. When favorably positioned, 4 Vesta can be seen in dark skies. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short amount of time. [3] As of April 2022, the Minor Planet Center had data on 1,199,224 minor planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 614,690 had enough information to be given numbered designations</p>

        <h1>C-TYPE ASTERIOD</h1>
         <div class="about"> The carbonaceous asteroids are abundant in the solar system (almost 75% of the known asteroids are of this type), especially on the edge of the asteroid belt between Mars and jupiter (some astronomers say that another planet could have formed in that asteroid belt if jupiter's gravity wasn't so massive, but now a possible planet lies in pieces in between Mars and Jupiter). 
    </div>
        <h1>S-TYPE ASTERIOD</h1>
        <div class="stype">After the C-type asteroids, we have the S-type asteroids made of silicate and iron- nickel to be the next most abundant group in our system. They are very common on the inner edge of the asteroid belt and contribute 17% of the total asteroids in the entire system
